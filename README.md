Collection of repositories to explore the creation of CSAS documents

This documents relies on the R package csasdown - which facilitates generating Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (CSAS) documents in PDF or Word format using R Markdown and bookdown. Pandoc and LaTeX are required. More information is available here: https://github.com/pbs-assess/csasdown  and a typical Latex setup is using tinytex installed through R on Windows. A detailed description of the installation process used is available here: https://github.com/pbs-assess/csasdown/wiki/Latex-Installation-for-csasdown
